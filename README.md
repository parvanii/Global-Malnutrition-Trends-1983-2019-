# üìä Global Malnutrition Trends: Power BI Analysis (1983‚Äì2019)

## üìå Introduction

ABC Company is undertaking an in-depth analysis of global malnutrition trends from 1983 to 2019 to better understand the prevalence and distribution of various forms of malnutrition among children under five years of age. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank, the project focuses on key malnutrition indicators: **severe wasting**, **wasting**, **stunting**, **underweight**, and **overweight**.

The analysis segments countries by **income classifications**‚Äîlow, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income‚Äîas well as categories such as **Least Developed Countries (LDC)**, **Low Income Food Deficient (LIFD)**, **Land Locked Developing Countries (LLDC)**, and **Small Island Developing States (SIDS)**. Power BI visualizations, including **stacked bar charts**, **line charts**, and **ribbon charts**, are used to uncover critical trends and regional disparities.

Malnutrition remains a significant global health issue, with disproportionate impacts on children in lower-income regions. This project aims to identify correlations between economic status and malnutrition rates and highlight areas in need of urgent intervention.

## üìä Project Overview

This Power BI analysis provides actionable insights into global child malnutrition patterns over 36 years. Key objectives include:

- Identifying correlations between income classifications and malnutrition types.
- Highlighting trends in underweight and overweight conditions.
- Evaluating country-level disparities and the effect of economic status on nutrition outcomes.
- Supporting data-driven decision-making for policy development and resource allocation.

Visuals reflect a combination of statistical depth and accessibility for decision-makers, with data sourced from global health organizations and robust sample sizes (e.g., 11 million survey records).
